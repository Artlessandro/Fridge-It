# Fridge-It

Fridge It is a mobile application that functions to help users become more aware of or monitor the 
contents/items they put inside the fridge. The contents may vary from fresh ingredients, dairy product, 
fruits & vegetables, and others, which the existence is limited to an expiration date. It is not just limited 
to fridge as a storage, but its functionality also applies to other kitchen appliances, such as freezer 
and pantry. Additionally, the mobile application has another useful feature, which is a shopping list 
that allows users to thoroughly plan & list the items they want to get before shopping as a reminder.
